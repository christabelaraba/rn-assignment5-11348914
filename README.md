## React Native Theme Switching App

## Brief Report

For this assignment, I created a React Native mobile app that lets users switch between light and dark themes. The app has two main screens - a Home screen and a Settings screen.

On the Home screen, there is a header with the app title, a search bar, and different content categories. Each category is displayed using a custom CategoryCard component.

The Settings screen has a header and a theme toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. I used a theme context to manage the current theme state and apply it across the entire app.

Throughout the app, I used custom components like Header, SearchBar, CategoryCard, ThemeToggle, and SettingsItem. This helped me maintain a consistent design and make the code more reusable.

I also made sure the app's layout and styling closely match the provided UI design. This included using the right colors, fonts, and spacing.

I used React Native, Expo, React Navigation, and the Context API to build this app. This allowed me to create a functional and visually appealing mobile application that meets the requirements of the assignment.

Overall, this was a valuable learning experience, as I got to apply my knowledge of React Native, custom components, and UI design.
